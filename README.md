# rUUID

I couldn't find a tool that generates uuid's of various formats _conveniently_ and programatically over the cli and rUUID was born. Necessity is the mother of "I can't find it, I'll make it".

This crate only depends on `uuid` and `clap` crates.

# Usage

There are subcommands for each type of supported uuid's. Any uuid formats supported by `uuid` are supported by `rUUID` as well.

TODO finish the readme.
